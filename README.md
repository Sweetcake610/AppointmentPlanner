# AppointmentPlanner
### Appointment Planner Challenge Project with the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Certification program.

In this project, you will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. 
The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.
You will work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks. The requirements section will walk through 
implementing the app from the topmost component down. If you would like to implement it in a different order, feel free to do what is comfortable for you.

To complete this project, you should be familiar with fundamental React concepts, including:

* JSX
* React Components
* Components Interacting
* Hooks
* React Programming Patterns
* React Styles
* React Forms
